Report: Solving the N-Queens Problem Using Backtracking
Introduction
The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem in computer science. The objective is to place n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. A queen can attack another queen if they share the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem can be generalized for any value of n, but it becomes increasingly complex as n grows.

Backtracking is a common algorithmic technique used to solve such constraint satisfaction problems. It involves exploring all potential solutions and abandoning those that do not meet the required conditions, thereby "backtracking" to previous states to try different possibilities.

Problem Definition
Given an n x n chessboard, place n queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. This means:

No two queens share the same row.
No two queens share the same column.
No two queens share the same diagonal.
Backtracking Algorithm
The backtracking approach incrementally builds solutions and abandons them if they are not feasible. For the N-Queens problem, the algorithm can be outlined as follows:

Initialize the board: Start with an empty board.
Place queens: Place queens one by one in different rows.
Check validity: For each placed queen, ensure it is not attacked by any previously placed queen.
Recursive placement: Move to the next row and attempt to place a queen in a column that does not conflict with any previous queens.
Backtrack if necessary: If no valid column is found in the current row, backtrack to the previous row and move the previously placed queen to the next column.
Repeat: Continue the process until all queens are placed on the board without conflicts.

Validity Check
To ensure that placing a queen at a given position does not result in any attacks, we need to check:

The current column for any existing queens.
The upper left diagonal.
The upper right diagonal.
Recursive Backtracking Algorithm
The recursive backtracking function will try to place queens row by row, ensuring that each placement is valid. If a valid position is found, the function will proceed to the next row. If no valid position is found, the function will backtrack and try the next column in the previous row.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the backtracking algorithm:

Base Case: If all queens are placed, print or store the solution.
Recursive Case:
For each column in the current row:
Check if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe.
If safe, place the queen and move to the next row.
If the placement leads to a solution, return true.
If not, remove the queen (backtrack) and try the next column.

Explanation of the Implementation
Initialization:

Create a board initialized with . (indicating empty cells).
solutions array to store all possible solutions.
isSafe Function:

Checks if placing a queen at board[row][col] is safe.
Verifies there are no queens in the same column, upper left diagonal, or upper right diagonal.
solve Function:

Recursive function that attempts to place a queen in each column of the current row.
If a safe position is found, the queen is placed, and the function recursively attempts to place a queen in the next row.
If placing the queen leads to no solution, the queen is removed (backtracking).
Base Case:

If row === n, all queens are placed, and a solution is found.
The current board configuration is added to solutions.
Starting the Solution:

Call solve(0) to start from the first row.
This approach ensures that all possible configurations are explored, and only valid solutions are considered. Backtracking allows the algorithm to efficiently find solutions by pruning invalid configurations early.

Conclusion
The N-Queens problem demonstrates the power and elegance of the backtracking algorithm. By systematically exploring and abandoning paths that lead to invalid solutions, backtracking can efficiently solve complex constraint satisfaction problems. The N-Queens problem, although simple to understand, offers deep insights into the workings of recursive algorithms and constraint satisfaction techniques.
